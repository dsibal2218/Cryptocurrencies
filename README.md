# Cryptocurrencies
**Overview**:

Now that we have some understanding what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA, we will use these skills by creating an analysis of the cryptocurrency market.

Deliverable 1: Using our knowledge of Pandas, we’ll preprocess the dataset in order to perform PCA in Deliverable 2.

Deliverable 2: Using our knowledge of how to apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, we’ll reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.

Deliverable 3: Using our knowledge of the K-means algorithm, we’ll create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then, we’ll run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data.

Deliverable 4: Using our knowledge of creating scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot, we’ll visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components we created in Deliverable 2, then we’ll create a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
